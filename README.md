# Exo Last Brief
This is just an exercise for our last practice project "E-Shop" (in this case our project is ChampiFestin).

This exercise (as all my current and future projects) is using TypeScript and SASS. And for this specific exercise and project we're going to use API Platform in Symfony 6.
## How to install
You will first want to clone the repo and get into the main folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/Zen-kun04/Exo-Last-Brief.git
cd Exo-Last-Brief
```
Now go into the symfony folder, rename the `.env.dist` to `.env` and modify the settings as you want (you should start by modifying the database):
```
cd symfony
cp .env.dist .env
```
Finally you just have to initialize the instances:
```
cd symfony
symfony serve
```
```
cd symfony
npm run watch
```
```
cd next
npm run dev
```
